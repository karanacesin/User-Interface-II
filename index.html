                <p>I am a spirit filled Christian.</p>
                <p>In December of 2010 I graduated from Pennsylvania College of Technology with an Associate's Degree in Technical Support. During my time in the technical support program I was required to take a basic web development class. After graduation I realized that I really enjoyed building and designing websites and wanted to continue to learn more about it. Over the last few years I have looked at different schools that offered a web development/web design program in the hopes of finding one that I would be able to attend which is what lead me to Lambda School. I am excited to learn as much as I can and be able to continue on after graduation in the web development field.</p>
